How? DataCore's software continuously migrates, load balances and safeguards data among on-premises and cloud storage tiers using machine learning and arbitrage modeling to optimise for cost, performance, capacity, availability, compliance as well as other business objectives.

The solution is called vFilO. Using vFilO, inactive data is de-duplicated, compressed, and moved to lower cost storage such as a cloud S3 bucket. DataCore’s enterprise-class, scale-out data services are unconstrained by hardware infrastructure or geography and include live data mobility, self-service undelete, snapshots/clones and replication at any level of granularity.</td>

                    <td>Uptime is a requirement in today’s connected world.  Industries, such as Power Utilities, Telecommunications, Healthcare and Data Centers rely on uninterruptible power for critical continuity.  However, what happens when the power grid does go down?  Revenue ceases, instability can cause panic and most importantly, lives could be lost.  All are high risk scenarios that can be avoided when critical power solutions are in place. 

As complex as the power grid can be, critical power battery backup systems utilized to maintain emergency power integrity are just as complex.  Testing and monitoring the power grid and its batteries allows for the ability to identify issues in advance and provide proactive solutions. 

From advising to innovative products, Franklin Electric | Grid Solutions provides the expertise required for ensuring uptime, thus considerably reducing the risk and cost that follows power grid downtime.</td>

Our footprint product for the DC market is our unique DataCool Hose range which provides significantly more flexibility than standard hose offers as DataCool hoses offer both lateral and torsional movement.

 

Alongside the DataCool hose will be our stainless steel over braided peroxide cured epdm assemblies for connections where torsional flexibility is not required.

 

For applications that required working parameters above what a rubber hose can offer we will be showing our convoluted stainless steel hose assemblies which will include Hygienic and threaded end connections.

 

There will also be the launch of an exciting new addition to the DataCool range at the show.

 

I look forward to catching up with you at the show

TileFlow can be used to identify the causes of cooling problems and rectify them, and to design cooling systems for new data centers. TileFlow displays pictures/videos of hot spots, wasted cold air, and temperature distribution in the data center. TileFlow results have been validated for real-life data centers.

In addition to CFD simulation, TileFlow can be used for real-time temperature monitoring of data centers. TileFlow imports the data from temperature sensors, depicts the sensors and their temperature values, creates temperature maps using sensors data, and updates the maps dynamically.

Many data center managers, engineering firms, equipment manufacturers, and consulting companies around the world are using TileFlow.</td>
